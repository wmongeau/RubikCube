# RubikCube
This Rubik's cube simulation is based on [*The Coding Train's Tutorial*](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/142.1-rubiks-cube.html) and is still in progress.
It is written in **Java** using *Processing* and implements matrix transformations.

I hope to add these elements soon: 
- Different dimensions for the cube (*4x4, 5x5, etc*)
- A timer for solving that stops itself when the cube is solved
- An AI that can solve the cube
